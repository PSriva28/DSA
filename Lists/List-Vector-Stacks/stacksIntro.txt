Stacks Data Structure
- they are abstract data types
real life scenarios are- from the stack of plates, we first pickup the first plate which is apprently kept at the last. 
                        2- three balls present in container, you will pick the top ball which is apprently kept at the last;
In short, Last In First Out - LIFO based

Stack = a list with the restriction that the insertion and the deletion can happen from one end only that is top.

Insertion happens through push and deletions happen through pop
other methods are isEmpty - to check if the stack is empty or not, Top/peek - to return the last of the stack

Applications where stack can be used - 
1- undoing in the editor. ctrl+z 
2- balancing brackets
3- function calls/recursion

Implementation - 
1- Array 
2 - Linked List
