Sliding window is technique when we have to make a window of contiguos elements and that window keeps on sliding towards right or left.
When to use:- 
     1-Used only when the size of the window is given
     2-if not size then atleast some condition is given, and 
     3-when you have only the positive integers. 
(if no size or condition given then go for Kadane's Algorithm)
If questions ask to find - subarray of size K, substring, or contigues elements/
There are two types of SW:-
Fixed SW
and Dynamic SL
